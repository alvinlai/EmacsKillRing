# Emacs Kill Ring for Sublime Text 2

## Background

This is an adaption of the [EmacsKillRing][1] for [Sublime Text 2][2]. It was created 
for the ST2 alpha, so it may need some adjustments to work with the final release.

I don’t know who the original author is, but (s)he did most of the hard work, I
mostly adapted the code to conform to the new API and added region highlighting
when a mark has been set.

Please note that I am not very familiar with Python, so there may be extremely
silly bugs. I’d be happy to include your improvements.

## Usage

Copy EmacsKillRing.py to your Packages/User folder, then add some key-bindings for
the new commands, like so:

    { "keys": ["ctrl+w"], "command": "expand_selection", "args": {"to": "word"} },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+k"], "command": "emacs_kill_line" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+y"], "command": "paste" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+space"], "command": "emacs_set_mark" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+w"], "command": "emacs_kill_to_mark" },
    { "keys": ["alt+w"], "command": "emacs_kill_ring_save" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+g"], "command": "cancel_mark" }

    { "keys": ["ctrl+f"], "command": "move", "args": {"by": "characters", "forward": true} },
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+f"], "command": "move", "args": {"by": "characters", "forward": true, "extend": true}, "context": 
		[
			{ "key": "emacs_has_mark", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
		]
	},

	{ "keys": ["ctrl+b"], "command": "move", "args": {"by": "characters", "forward": false} },	
	{ "keys": ["ctrl+b"], "command": "move", "args": {"by": "characters", "forward": false, "extend": true}, "context":
		[
			{ "key": "emacs_has_mark", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
		]
	},


There is a small gotcha here: I have set up ctrl+w to select the current word,
like in TextMate, but that doesn’t fit well with the default Emacs key bindings,
where ctrl+w means kill-region. So there is a simple check in EmacsKillRing.py
which switches between these two behaviors, based on whether a mark has been set.
If a mark has been set, do kill-region. If not, do expand_selection. For me, this
works quite well, but it would of course be much better to use contexts for this.
Please get in touch if you know how to create a custom context in a plugin.
